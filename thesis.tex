\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}

In March 2017, our research group went on a ski retreat in the Swiss Alps.
After a full day of skiing on the Diablerets massif, we gathered for a lab dinner.
Denys Shabalin, who was working on Scala Native at the time \citep{shabalin2020just}, started a conversation about manual memory management.
The discussion revolved around the following question: could a Rust-like ownership system be viable for Scala?
Denys' answer was clear: ownership is fundamentally at odds with the way Scala handles references, and without making deep changes to Scala's type system, the task was simply impossible.

The next day, I came up with a proof-of-concept domain-specific language (DSL), which implements the basis of a linear type system using type-level programming.
Here is an example of a short program written in this DSL:

\memImplicitMainCodeSection

\noindent
The type argument of \scala{Context} is a type-level list of strings that corresponds to the memory regions allocated at each program point.
Methods of \scala{Context} use type-level programming techniques to enforce the following properties:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item memory regions must be allocated (\scala{malloc}) \emph{before} they are deallocated (\scala{free}),
  \item all memory regions must be deallocated by the end of the program,
  \item dereferencing (\scala{deref}) is only allowed on previously allocated regions.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
The implementation makes use of Scala's implicits to enforce these properties.
While this small DSL is obviously too simplistic to be of any practical use, it demonstrates the power of type-level programming.

% 2. Identify the Research Gap
My solution implemented the impossible, I was delighted!
Denys, however, was not impressed.
I attribute this apathy to his animosity toward implicits.
Despite their widespread usage, implicits are notorious for their complexity \citep{filip2019implicits}.

to the animosity toward

In particular, \emph{type-level programming} with implicits, is among the more advanced...

In the interest of keeping this introduction concise, we will postpone explaining the details of * to \Cref{chap:ab-using-implicits}.

Computing types with implicits is among the , and pehaps what give the feature them their bad reputation.

Type-level programming is among the most extreme

Programming with implicits is not an easy task, there are many

so that the reader can get a feel of what type-level programming looked like in 2017's Scala.
We will postpone the detailed presentation
Although we differ
at compile time (we discuss the details of this implementation in \Cref{chap:ab-using-implicits}).

\memImplicitContextCodeSection
trait Context[Ps <: HList]:
  def free[V <: Singleton, Out <: HList]
    (v: V)
    (implicit ev: Remove[V, Ps, Out])
    : Context[Out]

\memImplicitRemoveCodeSection
trait Remove[V, Ps <: HList, O <: HList]

object Remove:
  implicit def casehead[V, Ps <: HList, O <: HList]
    : Remove[V, V :: Ps, Ps] = new Remove {}

  implicit def casetail[V, Ph, Pt <: HList, O <: HList]
    (implicit ev: Remove[V, Pt, O])
    : Remove[V, Ph :: Pt, Ph :: O] = new Remove {}



His apathy was likely due the heavy usage of implicits,

Implicits have a rather bad reputation in some * of the Scala community.


% 3. State the Background Information
TLP isn't new. GHC' Haskell is leading the charge with the numerous language extentions developped over the las decate. Unfortunetly, many of the techniques developed in the context of Haskell are not directly applicable to other programming languages. In particular, subtying ...

Dependently typed languages unify the term and type language, and are thus naturally able to express TLP. Unfortunetly...

% 5. Mention the Hypothesis
We can do better! Implicit-based TLP can be better expressed by first class language construct.
