\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}

In March 2017, our research group went on a ski retreat in the Swiss Alps.
After a full day of skiing on the Diablerets massif, we gathered for a lab dinner.
Denys Shabalin, who was working on Scala Native at the time \citep{shabalin2020just}, started a conversation about manual memory management.
The discussion revolved around the following question: could a Rust-like ownership system be viable for Scala?
Denys' answer was clear: ownership is fundamentally at odds with the way Scala handles references, and without making deep changes to Scala's type system, the task was simply impossible.

The next day, I came up with a toy domain-specific language (DSL), which implements the basis of a linear type system using type-level programming.
Here is an example of a short program written in this DSL:

\memImplicitMainCodeSection

\noindent
The type argument of \scala{Context} is a type-level list of strings that corresponds to the memory regions allocated at each program point.
Methods of \scala{Context} use type-level programming techniques to enforce the following properties:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item memory regions must be allocated (\scala{malloc}) \emph{before} they are deallocated (\scala{free}),
  \item all memory regions must be deallocated by the end of the program,
  \item dereferencing (\scala{deref}) is only allowed on previously allocated regions.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
The implementation makes use of Scala's implicits to enforce these properties.
While this small DSL is obviously too simplistic to be of any practical use, it demonstrates the power of type-level programming.

% 2. Identify the Research Gap
I was delighted with my solution!
Denys, however, was not impressed.
I attribute this apathy to his dislike of implicits.
Despite their widespread usage, implicits are notorious for their complexity \citep{filip2019implicits}.
In particular, using implicits for type-level computations requires carefully crafted definitions following a specific pattern.
To give the reader a glance of this pattern, we show the definition of the \scala{free} method on \scala{Context}:

\memImplicitContextCodeSection
% trait Context[Ps <: HList]:
%   def free[V <: Singleton, Out <: HList]
%     (v: V)
%     (implicit ev: Remove[V, Ps, Out])
%     : Context[Out]

In this definition uses three parameter lists, one for type parameters (\scala{V} and \scala{Out}), one for a value parameter (\scala{v}), and one of an implicit value parameter (\scala{ev}).
Only the second parameter list is intended to be specified at the use site; the type and implicit parameters are intended to be inferred.
When a user writes \scala{.free("mem")} he only sets the \scala{v} parameter to \scala{v = "mem"}; the compiler takes care of finding valid assignments for \scala{V}, \scala{Out} and \scala{ev}.
The implicit parameter of type \scala{Remove[V, Ps, Out]} type is the entry point to the world of type-level programming: it specifies how \scala{V} (constrained by \scala{v: V}), \scala{Ps} (defined in the class}, and \scala{Out} (unconstrained) are interrelated.
The definition of \scala{Remove}

\memImplicitRemoveCodeSection
% trait Remove[V, Ps <: HList, O <: HList]

% object Remove:
%   implicit def casehead[V, Ps <: HList, O <: HList]
%     : Remove[V, V :: Ps, Ps] = new Remove {}

%   implicit def casetail[V, Ph, Pt <: HList, O <: HList]
%     (implicit ev: Remove[V, Pt, O])
%     : Remove[V, Ph :: Pt, Ph :: O] = new Remove {}

is, to say the least, *very* convoluted


His apathy was likely due the heavy usage of implicits,

Implicits have a rather bad reputation in some * of the Scala community.


% 3. State the Background Information
TLP isn't new. GHC' Haskell is leading the charge with the numerous language extentions developped over the las decate. Unfortunetly, many of the techniques developed in the context of Haskell are not directly applicable to other programming languages. In particular, subtying ...

Dependently typed languages unify the term and type language, and are thus naturally able to express TLP. Unfortunetly...

% 5. Mention the Hypothesis
We can do better! Implicit-based TLP can be better expressed by first class language construct.
